#   Description:
#       Build reference genome and transcriptome for all aligners.
#
#       All necessary tools are assumed to be in PATH.  If this is not
#       the case, add whatever code is needed here to gain access.
#       (Adding such code to your .bashrc or other startup script is
#       generally a bad idea since it's too complicated to support
#       every program with one environment.)

# Choose cdna.sh or gtf2fasta.sh, or download the prebuilt kallisto
# file mus_musculus.tar.gz, extract, and copy transcriptome.idx to
# Data/03-kallisto-index/all-but-xy.index.
#
# There are multiple possible transcriptome references that can be used with
# kallisto.
#
# There are many gene IDs referenced in the GTF/GFF that are not in the CDNA.
# FIXME: Document the reason for this.  Are these predicted genes?
#
# There are a few gene IDs in the release 98 CDNA that are not in the GFF.
# If downstream analysis involved looking up genes in the GFF, this could
# result in a few misses.  This caused minor problems for CNC-EMDiff, which
# used CDNA as the reference.
#
# More importantly, the CDNA does not document features such as exons, UTRs,
# etc.  If downstream analysis will examine such features, use the GFF.
